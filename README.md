## Project Insights

1. **Drama is the Most Dominant Genre**
   Drama appears more frequently than any other genre, either alone or in
   combination with others, confirming its strong presence across all decades
   of filmmaking.

2. **Christopher Nolan Leads in Average Ratings**
   Among directors with at least five movies, Christopher Nolan consistently
   receives the highest IMDb scores - showcasing both quality and
   consistency.

3. **Movie Production Peaked Around 2010-2015**
   The number of movies released each year surged dramatically during the
   2000's, peaking around 2014 before dipping- likely due to shifts in
   digital media consumption.

4. **High IMDb Scores Don't Always Equal High Revenue**
   A scatter plot comparing IMDb scores and box office gross reveals weak
   correlation, suggesting factors like marketing and franchise popularity
   influence revenue more than critical acclaim.
