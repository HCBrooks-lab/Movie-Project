# IMDb Movie Ratings Analysis 

This project explores a dataset of movies sourced from IMDb. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights related to IMDb scores, genres, budgets, directors, and more.

---

## Project Goals

- Clean and prepare raw movie data
- Identify patterns in IMDb ratings
- Visualize relationships between variables such as:
  - Budget vs. IMDb score
  - Genre vs. average rating
  - Director performance
- Summarize key findings with clear visuals

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Git & GitHub
- SQLite (via 'sqlite3')
- GitHub

---

# Key SQL Queries Included

- Top 10 movies by IMdb score
- Average score per director (min 3 movies)
- Most common genres (top 15)
- Director with the most films
- IMDb score by movie duration category

---

## Visualizations

- Bar chart of top genres by count (coming soon)
- Average IMDb scores by duration category

---

## What You'll Learn

This project demonstrates how to:
- Import and clean dataset in Pandas
- Load data into SQL's for complex SQL queries
- Visualize SWL query results in Python
- Combine data analysis skills into a portfolo-ready notebook
